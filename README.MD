## Introduction

Introduction to Cybersecurity is a subject that provides foundational knowledge about the principles and concepts of cybersecurity. 

It covers various aspects such as understanding the different types of threats in the cyber environment, the security mechanisms used in networks, operating systems, and applications to enhance security, and the basic legal and regulatory rules related to cybersecurity. 

The subject also provides various resources including presentations, documentation, code examples, and links to further information sources for a deeper understanding of cybersecurity topics. 

The aim of this subject is to enable students and other interested individuals to gain a basic understanding of cybersecurity issues and provide access to useful materials and information related to this field.

## Topics Included

### Threat Modelling

In the segment dedicated to threat modeling, the emphasis was placed on the development of a secure architecture, the implementation of threat countermeasures, and the subsequent generation of a comprehensive report, tailored to the specific assignment requirements, concerning the security aspects of a web application.

### Risk Management

In the Risk Management section, we delved into various security methodologies including, but not limited to, Attack Tree, STRIDE, PASTA, OWASP, and DREAD. The threat model, initially established in the Threat Modelling segment, was revised to incorporate the new ADFS (Active Directory Federation Services) component. Concurrently, threats were re-evaluated and re-assessed in accordance with the STRIDE security model.

### Network Layer Security

In the Network Layer Security segment, the primary focus was on the establishment of a secure network design, complemented by key components integral to network security such as VLAN, Firewall, VPN Tunnel, and DMZ. Additionally, the SIEM solution and IoT security probe were incorporated into the design to facilitate network scanning at the most critical junctures of the network.

### Attacks on Web Applications

In the Attacks on Web Applications section, we conducted an assault on a known vulnerable application, specifically the OWASP Juice Shop. This exercise involved the execution of various types of cyber attacks to demonstrate their potential impact and the importance of robust web application security.
